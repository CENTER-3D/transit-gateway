### VPC connections across IBM Cloud accounts
You can now connect to a VPC in another IBM Cloud account by providing the CRN of the VPC when adding a connection to your transit gateway. The account containing the VPC is then able to view the gateway and all of its connections, and must choose to opt-in to allow account-to-account interconnectivity for that VPC.

For more information see [Adding a cross-account (VPC only) connection](/docs/transit-gateway?topic=transit-gateway-edit-gateway#adding-cross-account-connections)

### Open source SDKs
Open source Software Development Kits have now been published for use with Python, Node, Go, and Java platforms.
